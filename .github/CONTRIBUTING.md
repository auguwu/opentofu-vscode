## Bug Reporting

Think you might've ran into a bug that should never happen? It happens to the best of us sometimes! To submit a bug report, you can create one via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/auguwu/opentofu-vscode).

Before you do, make sure that it's something that someone hasn't already reported! You can surf through the [issue board] to see if anyone has already reported it. It'll be tagged with the `bug` label.

- Be clear and concise with the title and description of the bug! It'll help others link their issues and possible solution to yours.
- Please specify any way to reproduce the bug, so we know where to look and fix it!

## Development Environment

For Nix/NixOS users, we maintain a [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) to standardise the development workflow, it includes the following tools:

- Node.js
- `pnpm`

To enter the workflow, you can use `direnv allow` and it'll propagate a [direnv]:

```shell
direnv: loading ~/git/noeltowa/opentofu-vscode
direnv: loading https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nix-community/nix-direnv/3.0.6/direnvrc (sha256-RYcUJaRMf8oF5LznDrlCXbkOQrywm0HDv1VjYGaJGdM=)

```

You can also use `nix shell` or `nix develop` as well. Since we use [Nix flakes], we provide a fallback for people who don't use Nix flakes.

For non Nix/NixOS users, we recommend installing the following tools on your system (if you haven't already):

- Node.js
- `pnpm` (`npm i -g pnpm`)
