### üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏èü´ñ [OpenTofu]: Visual Studio Code | Extension

#### _Visual Studio Code extension for [OpenTofu]_

This project aims to be a successor towards [`gamunu/vscode-opentofu`], the extension that I've been using but it came that it hasn't been maintained and is a fork of [`hashicorp/vscode-terraform`]. This is a whole different project with different views that I hope you can understand. :)

The one thing you might notice is no webviews. That wasn't in my list of plans for this extension, this extension was made to have a MVP of the OpenTofu Language Server and have formatting capabilities, that's pretty much it.
