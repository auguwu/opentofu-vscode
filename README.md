### 🐻‍❄️🫖 [Terraform] and [OpenTofu]: Visual Studio Code | Extension
#### *Extension that allows to interop between [Terraform] and [OpenTofu] easily.*

This project aims to be a successor towards [`gamunu/vscode-opentofu`], the extension that I've been using but it came that it hasn't been maintained and is a fork of [`hashicorp/terraform-vscode`], which is fine but I would like to easily interop Terraform and OpenTofu's LSPs ([`terraform-ls`] and the experimental [`opentofu-lsp`]) easily.
