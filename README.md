### 🐻‍❄️🫖 [OpenTofu]: Visual Studio Code | Extension

#### _Visual Studio Code extension for [OpenTofu]_

This project aims to be a successor towards [`gamunu/vscode-opentofu`], the extension that I've been using but it came that it hasn't been maintained and is a fork of [`hashicorp/vscode-terraform`]. This is a whole different project with different views that I hope you can understand. :)
